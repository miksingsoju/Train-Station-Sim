/**
 * 4. **Schedules:**
   - Simulate trains stopping at each station for a set duration.
   - Introduce random delays to mimic real-world scenarios.

5. **Passenger Flow:**
   - Generate a random number of passengers arriving at each station during the simulation.
   - Passengers should alight at random or predefined stations.

   Each station stop should last a defined number of seconds (e.g., 3 seconds).
   - Delays should occur randomly with a probability (e.g., 20% chance of delay).
